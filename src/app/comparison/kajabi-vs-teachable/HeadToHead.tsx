        <b>Features:</b> Kajabi offers a true all-in-one platform (courses, memberships, email, website, funnels, podcasting). Teachable focuses on course delivery and coaching, with fewer built-in marketing tools.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Ease of Use:</b> Teachable is simpler and more beginner-friendly. Kajabi is more powerful but has a steeper learning curve.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Design & Customization:</b> Kajabi provides more polished templates and flexible site/page builders. Teachable is more basic but easy to set up.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Integrations:</b> Kajabi has more built-in tools, while Teachable relies more on third-party integrations (Zapier, etc.).
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Value for Money:</b> Teachable is much cheaper, but Kajabi can replace several other tools if you use its full suite.
