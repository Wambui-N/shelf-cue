      <b>HubSpot</b> is the best choice if you need a complete marketing, sales, and service solution. While it's more expensive, the all-in-one platform can replace multiple tools and provides enterprise-grade features that scale with your business.

      <b>ActiveCampaign</b> is the winner if email marketing and automation are your primary needs. It offers better value for money, more granular automation features, and a simpler learning curveâ€”perfect for businesses focused on email marketing.
